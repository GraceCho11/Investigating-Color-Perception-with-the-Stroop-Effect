# Investigating-Color-Perception-with-the-Stroop-Effect
The objective of this study is to investigate a classic phenomenon known as the Stroop Effect. Participants were presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a specific color. The participants were asked to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word was printed. There are two conditions in this study: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. If the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed, (i.e. RED, BLUE), then this is congruent words condition. If the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed, (i.e. PURPLE, ORANGE), then this is an incongruent words condition. In each case, the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists were recorded.
